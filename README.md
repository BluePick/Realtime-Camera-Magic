# Realtime-Camera-Magic
iOS Swift Realtime video manipulation
This is an example of how to get iOS Camera input into a Metal Texture and present that on screen.
This may be useful to provide some shader on the camera input or other image processing. It runs at 60hz while passing through some intense shaders. Triple buffered.
